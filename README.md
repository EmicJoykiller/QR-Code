The QR Code project is a front-end design exercise focused on creating a visually appealing and responsive webpage. The page features a centered card containing a QR code image, accompanied by a headline and descriptive text. The QR code directs users to Frontend Mentor, a platform designed to help developers enhance their front-end development skills through hands-on projects. The webpage uses modern CSS techniques, such as flexbox for layout, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface across different devices. The design emphasizes accessibility and usability, making it an excellent addition to any developer's portfolio.

Project Explanation and Accessibility Best Practices
This project demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a responsive and accessible interface. The clean, minimal design highlights essential content, making it easy for users to scan and interact with the QR code.

Accessibility Best Practices Implemented:

Semantic HTML: The use of semantic elements like <header>, <main>, and <footer> provides a meaningful structure, improving the page's readability for screen readers.
Text Alternatives for Images: The alt attribute in the QR code image ensures that visually impaired users understand the purpose of the image, even if they can't see it.
High Contrast Colors: The color scheme includes a good contrast ratio between text and background, making the content easily readable.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on various devices.
Accessible Font: The chosen font, 'Outfit,' is easy to read, and font sizes are appropriately set to enhance legibility.
Keyboard Navigation: The design allows for navigation using a keyboard, ensuring accessibility for users with motor impairments.
By adhering to these best practices, the project not only demonstrates strong front-end skills but also a commitment to creating inclusive and accessible web experiences.
